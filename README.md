# hekili-tww
Hekili fork for The War Within beta client. 

No APLs / ability logic has been updated - only the minimal AddOn API changes for it to run on the beta client.

No github release is available - clone or download+unzip to your _beta_/Interface/AddOns folder.

I don't expect to put much more effort into this but hopefully a good base for others.

I've not worked with Hekili or even Lua much before so the code changes I made are not clean :( Was literally hacking at it to figure out what was broken and what would fix it.

## Known Issues
* Glower library doesn't work and not sure why (some issue with Blizzard Mixins API)
* Item recommendations might be buggy
* No new or reworked talents / spells / items have been added
* Any TWWE simcraft APLs have not been integrated
